# Project Frog Game

This project is made out of an educational course from Team Treehouse where you can find my profile and achievements at https://teamtreehouse.com/alexanderayala
The point of this game was to demostrate the abilities of adding JavaScript to a Github project called Phaser.io where the physics and the .png files are already in existence. 
Some parts of the game were really simple like adding the platforms and where the coins go, and then some others were more difficult like have your life lost tell you when you lose by collecting more poisons, or when you win via how many points collected via coins. This game really helped me grow!
There is nothing to contribute to the game unless you feel like making it cooler!
